# SDTP — SecDogie Tunnel Protocol (v1)

A minimal, from-scratch, single-peer encrypted UDP tunnel, written in C on
top of vetted primitives from libsodium (X25519, BLAKE2b, XChaCha20-Poly1305).
It is intentionally small enough to read end to end and learn from — it is
**not** an independently audited protocol. Treat it as a personal / educational
VPN, not as a replacement for WireGuard or IPsec in production.

This is the same wire protocol used by secdogie-tunnel. Implementations are
interoperable.

## Goals / non-goals

- Goal: confidentiality + integrity + mutual authentication + forward secrecy
  for a single client <-> server tunnel, carrying arbitrary IP traffic over a
  TUN device.
- Goal: small, auditable C codebase, no custom crypto primitives — only
  composition of libsodium primitives.
- Non-goal (v1): multi-peer mesh, rekeying of long-lived sessions, roaming
  across multiple source addresses, post-quantum resistance.

## Identity

Each peer has a long-term X25519 keypair (`static_pk` / `static_sk`),
generated with `dh-tunnel genkey`. Public keys are exchanged out of
band and hard-coded into each side's config, exactly like WireGuard peer
keys — SDTP has no PKI / CA / trust-on-first-use.

## Handshake (1-RTT, mutually authenticated, forward-secret)

This is a "triple-DH" construction (the same idea used by Signal's X3DH and
Noise's `IK` pattern), built directly from libsodium's `crypto_scalarmult`
(X25519) and `crypto_generichash` (BLAKE2b) rather than a full Noise
implementation.

Notation: `I` = initiator, `R` = responder. `I` knows `R_static_pk` ahead of
time (configured). `I` generates a fresh ephemeral keypair per session.

**Message 1 (I -> R), all fields plaintext except where noted:**

```
type            u8      = 1
session_id      u8[8]   random, chosen by I
i_static_pk     u8[32]
i_eph_pk        u8[32]
timestamp_ns    u64     big-endian, wall clock
mac1            u8[16]  crypto_auth over the preceding fields, keyed with
                        BLAKE2b("SDTP-mac1" || R_static_pk)[0:32]
```

`mac1` is not secrecy — it is a cheap proof that the sender has *looked up*
`R`'s public key, filtering random internet noise / naive scanners before R
does any DH math (same purpose as WireGuard's mac1).

R validates: mac1, and `timestamp_ns` is within a 60s window of local time
**and** strictly greater than the last accepted timestamp seen from this
`i_static_pk` (per-peer monotonic counter — the anti-replay for the
handshake itself).

R then generates a fresh ephemeral keypair and computes three DH shared
secrets:

```
dh1 = X25519(R_static_sk,  i_eph_pk)     // == X25519(i_eph_sk, R_static_pk)
dh2 = X25519(R_eph_sk,     i_static_pk)  // == X25519(i_static_sk, R_eph_pk)
dh3 = X25519(R_eph_sk,     i_eph_pk)     // == X25519(i_eph_sk, R_eph_pk)
```

`dh1` authenticates R to I (only the real R holds `R_static_sk`). `dh2`
authenticates I to R (only the real I holds `i_static_sk`). `dh3` is a
fresh, ephemeral-ephemeral secret that gives forward secrecy: recording all
static keys is not enough to reconstruct traffic keys.

Chaining key:

```
ck0 = BLAKE2b-256("SDTP-v1-chaining-key")
ck1 = BLAKE2b-256(ck0 || dh1)
ck2 = BLAKE2b-256(ck1 || dh2)
ck3 = BLAKE2b-256(ck2 || dh3)

key_i2r = BLAKE2b-256(ck3 || 0x01 || i_static_pk || R_static_pk)
key_r2i = BLAKE2b-256(ck3 || 0x02 || i_static_pk || R_static_pk)
```

**Message 2 (R -> I):**

```
type            u8    = 2
session_id      u8[8] echoed from message 1
r_eph_pk        u8[32]
confirm         u8[16 + 16]  XChaCha20-Poly1305(key_r2i, nonce=CONFIRM_NONCE,
                             aad = type||session_id||r_eph_pk,
                             plaintext="SDTP-HELLO-R2Iv1")
```

I computes the same three DH values, derives `key_i2r` / `key_r2i`, and
decrypts `confirm`. Successful decryption is **implicit proof R holds
`R_static_sk`** and completes mutual authentication.

`CONFIRM_NONCE` is fixed to `0x01` followed by 23 zero bytes so it can never
collide with data-channel nonces (which always start with 16 zero bytes).

If anything fails validation, the message is silently dropped — no error is
sent back to an unauthenticated peer.

## Data channel

Once the handshake completes both sides hold a pair of directional keys
(`key_i2r`, `key_r2i`). Each IP packet read off the TUN device becomes one
UDP datagram:

```
type            u8    = 3
session_id      u8[8]
counter         u64   big-endian, strictly increasing per sender, per session
ciphertext      XChaCha20-Poly1305(key, nonce = 16 zero bytes || counter,
                                   aad = type || session_id || counter,
                                   plaintext = raw IP packet from TUN)
```

The counter can never repeat for a given key (only ever incremented),
so nonce reuse is structurally impossible short of sending 2^64 packets.

**Replay protection:** the receiver tracks the highest counter accepted and
a 2048-entry sliding bitmap (same shape as WireGuard's), rejecting anything
already-seen or too far behind the window.

**Keepalive:** `type = 4`, empty ciphertext, sent every 25s of otherwise-idle
traffic to keep NAT/firewall UDP mappings alive.

## Hub mode

The wire protocol is point-to-point, but a single node can terminate many of
these tunnels at once and route between them. No protocol change:

- Handshake demux by trying configured peer keys until one authenticates.
- Data demux by the 8-byte `session_id` already on every datagram.
- Routing: decrypt inner IP, match destination tunnel IP, re-encrypt to that
  client (or write to the hub's own TUN).

Because the hub decrypts to route, **it can see inter-client traffic** — a
hub-and-spoke topology, not end-to-end encryption between clients.

## Known limitations

- No session rekeying — restart both sides for fresh forward secrecy.
- No peer roaming for pure server/client (hub adopts latest source address
  on authenticated data, so NAT rebind is tolerated there).
- Point-to-point per session; hub is decrypting hub-and-spoke, not a mesh.
- Not constant-time-audited beyond libsodium itself; surrounding C glue has
  not been reviewed by a third party. Personal / educational use only.
- Linux TUN is the current data-plane device; macOS utun is planned.
